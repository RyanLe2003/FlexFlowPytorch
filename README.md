# FlexFlow PyTorch

FlexFlow PyTorch is a system built on PyTorch that enables the expression, interpretation, and execution of parallel computation graphs. These graphs offer a flexible and powerful framework for jointly optimizing algebraic transformations and parallelization strategies, significantly improving distributed deep neural network (DNN) training.
